OXFORD_ASL analysis
===================

Functions
---------

    Output -> output(basil_name, output_name, subdir)

Outputs data from Basil, renaming it and regridding it to structural/standard space

    OutputMasked -> output_masked(output_name, subdir, mask)

As above, but with masking. Used in PV correction to output parameters by tissue type

    Calibrate -> calibrate(basil_name, output_name, m0val, multiplier, subdir)

Calibrate Basil parameter and output in all spaces

    Report -> report(output_name, subdir, masktype)

Report mean value of parameter within specified named mask - used to report PV values

    Normalise -> normalise(output_name, subdir, masktype)

Output parameter value normalised by dividing by mean within a mask- used in PVC

    Normalise_var -> normalise_var(output_name, subdir, masktype)

Output parameter variance normalised by dividing by mean squared within a mask - used in PVC

    Registration -> registration(regbase, transopt, distout)

Register an image to the structural image

    Calibration -> calibration()

Calculate M0 value for calibration in reference region method

    Dobasil -> do_basil()

Run BASIL

    Dooutput -> do_output(subdir)

Do all the output to a specified output space subdir

Proposed modules
----------------

The main `oxasl` program should end up as a series of calls to separate modules, each
of which has it's own command line tool as well as the direct API

Status
------

Steps 1-6 are at least partially implemented and functional
Step 7 (distcorr) is not yet implemented
Steps 8-9 (basil) are implemented
Steps 10-11 (re-registration and PVC) are not implemented
Step 12 (calib) is implemented
Step 13 (output) is incomplete
Step 14 (re-fit for PVC) is not implemented
Step 15 (epoch) is not implemented
Step 16 is not implemented

Data structures
---------------

How to pass data between modules? In particular data generated once should be re-used elsewhere, e.g.

 - Brain-extracted versions of images
 - Segmentations of structural image

Handle this using the `Workspace` class. Modules which need processed versions of data (e.g.
brain extracted structural) call the relevant module function to do this (e.g. `preproc_struc`).
Modules are responsible for:

 1. Not re-running themselves unnecessarily
 2. Not overwriting data provided explicitly (e.g. user-supplied brain extracted structural image)
